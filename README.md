## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to centre a div on a page, add rounded edges to an image, create a Github page to display my code and link the style sheet correctly to the project so that it displays correctly. 

```css 
.container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
 }
```
```css
 img{
    object-fit: cover;
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 10px;
 }
```
